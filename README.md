# transcript-2
Successor to transcript-client/transcript-server. Rewritten with cross compatibility and quality UI in mind.

## Improvements

* Improved compatibility with browsers like Safari.
* Login/Account system, less confusing to save and keep your work.
* Improved visuals, can now be used well on phones and tablets.

## Drawbacks

* Should be used with HTTPS/SSL, because users are passing plaintext passwords to the server.
* Does not yet have rules regarding passwords, people could theoretically set their password as empty, not ideal.
